# Spark_Amazon_Reviews_Analysis

### Background
Many of Amazon's shoppers depend on product reviews to make a purchase. Amazon makes these datasets publicly available. However, they are quite large and can exceed the capacity of local machines to handle. One dataset alone contains over 1.5 million rows; with over 40 datasets, this can be quite taxing on the average local computer. 

### Overview
The goal of this Project is to perform the ETL process completely in the cloud and upload a DataFrame to an RDS instance. The second goal is to use PySpark and SQL to perform a statistical analysis of selected data.
